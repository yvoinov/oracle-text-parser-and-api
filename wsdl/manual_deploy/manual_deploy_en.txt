Features   of   supporting   a  WSDL  service  deployed  via
Standalone OC4J.
------------------------------------------------------------

Note:   When   re-creating   a  user,  it  is  not  required
reinstalling  OC4J  or  redeploying  WSDL.  It  is enough to
recreate  the  user  schema,  install in it CTX_API and load
wrapper script webservices9_wrapper.sql

Attention!  If  the  WSDL  has  already  been deployed, when
rebuilding  the server code generation phase does not create
a  user  PL/SQL  wrapper  again. wrapper is generated in the
composition jar module and must be extracted from there with
a   zip  archiver.  By  default  on  UNIX  jar  file  before
deployment generated in /tmp .

Note: OC4J 10.1.3.3.0 has an issue with automatic deployment
of  the  WSDL  CTX_API  service.  Automatic  deployment only
happens in OC4J 10.1.3.2.0. Sometimes the problem is related
with non-release of the default ORMI port. Necessary restart
the  server  to  resolve  this  issue.  (default port number
23791)

Manual deployment of WSDL application on standalone OC4J
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Install OC4J.
2. Execute predeploy.sh script
3.  Perform preparatory steps (creating the owner schema DB,
installation   in   the   CTX   API   schema,  configuration
config.xml, configuring data-sources.xml)
4. Generate server code with gen_srv_code.sh script
5.  Unpack  using  unzip jar file (located inside ear file),
extract scripts from it:

   webservices9_wrapper.sql 
   webservices9_dropper.sql 

   and execute them in the API owner schema.
6.  Login  to  em  console  OC4J  (http://host:8888/em) with
username oc4jadmin and the password set in step 2.
7. Deploy the application generated in step 4.
8.  Edit  the  default-web-site.xml  of the OC4J instance by
explicitly  specifying  (or  by changing default http) ajp13
protocol for port 8888. (config/oc4j directory).
9.  Modify  Apache's  mod_oc4j.conf  file  as  shown  in the
mod_oc4j.conf file of this archive (config/ohs directory).
10.  Activate  automatic  launch  of OC4J and restart Apache
(OHS) and OC4J.
